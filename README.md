### Hey there ðŸ‘‹

Hello, my name is Evaldo Borba and I am currently a master student of Computer Science at University of Tsukuba.  
Research topics include applying machine learning algorithms/neural network to solve problems on the image field.  
And interests besides that include AR/VR, robotics and sports related data.  

Slowly, I will try to upload here some side-projects that I am working on:  
-If you like sports data, I would recommend check it out my repository about the Italia Serie A [here](https://github.com/ewalldo/Italia-Serie-A-Data-and-Data-Analysis).  
It has very detailed information about the match and player data for the past three seasons (will try to upload the previous ones soon) + the current one and some data analysis about it.  
Also (slowly) maintaining repositories with data about the 2020 Brazilian Serie A [(here)](https://github.com/ewalldo/Brazil-Serie-A-Data-and-Data-Analysis) and the 2020 Japanese J1 League [(here)](https://github.com/ewalldo/Japan-J1-League-Data-and-Data-Analysis)

-If you like competitive programming, I would recommend check it out the website [URI Online Judge](https://www.urionlinejudge.com.br/judge/en/login), which have problems of many different categories. And if you need help solving some of them, I have a repository [here](https://github.com/ewalldo/URI-OnlineJudge-Problems) where I upload the solution in Python and C# for the ones that I did (currently sitting at 600+ different problems).

If you look at my repositories you will also find some random machine learning problems and other things, feel free to play around with that.  
-[Conway's Game of Life using Unity/C#](https://github.com/ewalldo/Conway-s-Game-of-Life)  
-[Deep Dream algorithm implementation using Keras](https://github.com/ewalldo/Deep-Dream---Keras)  
-[Neural Style Tranfer using Keras](https://github.com/ewalldo/Neural-Style-Transfer---Keras)  
-[Solution for the problems on the SPOJ website](https://github.com/ewalldo/SPOJ-Problems)  

Any comments, suggestions, questions,... would be appreciated. Please don't hesitate to contact me at evaldo.lborba(at)gmail.com
